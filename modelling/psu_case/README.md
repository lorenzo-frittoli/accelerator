# Power Supply Case Model
There are 3 directories:
- `./external_components/` is for the parts that go around the prints. They are roughly modeled to ensure everything fits.
- `./printed_parts/` is for the stuff you can 3D-print.
- `./assembly/` is for the 3D model where everything is put together.

If you need to reprint something, open the main file in `./assembly/` and check its name. Then go in `./printed_parts/` and get its file.
